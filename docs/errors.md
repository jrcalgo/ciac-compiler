# Error Code Index

Stable diagnostics emitted by the compiler. Codes are append-only: once
published, a code's meaning never changes. `ciac explain <code>` prints
the same explanations; this page is checked against the registry by a
test.

| Code | Severity | Title |
|------|----------|-------|
| CIAC0001 | error | invalid token |
| CIAC0002 | error | unexpected token |
| CIAC0003 | error | duplicate declaration |
| CIAC0004 | error | pipeline has no matching component |
| CIAC0005 | error | missing capability for construct |
| CIAC0006 | error | cyclic dependency |
| CIAC0007 | warning | unreachable component |
| CIAC0008 | error | invalid auth placement |
| CIAC0009 | error | incompatible composition |
| CIAC0010 | error | missing service declaration |
| CIAC0011 | error | construct not supported by backend |
| CIAC0012 | error | duplicate capability |
| CIAC0013 | error | unknown provider |
| CIAC0014 | error | empty pipeline |

## Notes

- **CIAC0005** covers every capability requirement: `Auth` steps need
  `auth`, `Queue` steps and worker pipelines need `queue`, `crud` needs
  `db`, `events` needs `queue`.
- **CIAC0006** includes asynchronous cycles, e.g. a worker publishing to
  the queue it consumes from.
- **CIAC0007** is a warning: compilation succeeds, but the component is
  dead weight — wire it into a pipeline or remove it.
- **CIAC0011** is reported at `ciac build` time when the selected
  backend cannot implement a declared component (e.g. `queue Kafka`
  with the bundled backends); choose another provider or target.
